4.10 Rebasing a branch
the arrow is in the false direction.

7.10 Remote commands
missing pull

* Introduce git gui early to have reference during the workshop
* Think about overall project… something more visual?
* Have slides to show concept of remote
* Have exercise to pull/push changes… start with git fetch, and do git branch -r git rebase origin/master to update to latest version
* Update remote links etc.. (bugspot.net)
